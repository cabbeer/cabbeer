<span>I'm an independent designer, entrepreneur and tech enthusiast usually in Ottawa, Ontario, but often in Toronto, too. I'm also Director of Marketing at [Athlete Builder](http://athletebuilder.com/) , a complete sports e-learning platform.</span> 

I love the nature of startups: the bullishness, the naiveté, the unanticipated, the chaos, the compression. 

For a little over a year, I have been privileged to work at [Athlete Builder](http://athletebuilder.com/) as the director of marketing. I work on implementing new features, improving conversion and retention of our customers, and shaping the Athlete Builder voice through marketing experiments and writing.

### PERSPECTIVE

Perspective shapes your reality, so you must first shape your perspective. 

I am absolutely amazed to discover myself on this rock ball, rotating around this spherical fire… it’s a very odd situation! And the more I look at things, I cannot get rid of the feeling that existence is quite weird.

### OPTIMISM

I strive to be a technology optimist. Optimism is a meditation requiring
constant application. 


I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life...You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don't settle.

### CHANGE

“The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it and join the dance”

The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.

I believe there is an emerging confluence of simple technologies around books, publishing, networks and education that can be leveraged to change the way we
think about learning and information accessibility. If you're working in this space, I'd love to chat.
