	## Intro
Building the marketing machine for Athlete Builder was a great learning experience, through this process we gained valuable insight on how customers experience our product and interact with it's many moving parts.
 
The first step in building a marketing machine is understanding your audience. In my experience startups often overgeneralize who their initial users wil be. It's easy to imagine how you're product will bring value to a user in a vaccume, but once you put it online you're suddently competing with many direct and indirect alternatives as well as fighting a limited attention span to get across your message. 

In order to attract customers to your offering you have to speak to them in an authentic way. 

• Who are they? 
• Where are they?
What do they do online? What channels/ mediums are most effecting when wanting to communicate with them way. 


• How will we get them into our funnel?

Especially in early stages when you're validating a MVP, your initial users are the ones that will guide youre future development priorities. There are 2 main channels that lead into you'r marketing funnel. Your paid channels and your earned channels. 


• How can you make your platform particularly enticing to them right now?
• Why is this service indispensable? Or do you make it indispensable to them?

	## Building the machine

Once you've identified your buyers the next step is to diagram their buying processes. This diagram is breakdown of steps they will take in their buying process. Once you have mapped the customers purchasing steps you can add what procautions you will take to address their buying process. 

Think about the actions you will take to move prospects through the process. Examine the linkages between Actions to make sure the next steps are obvious. Examine the customer motivations for each Action

	## Instrumenting the machine

We would like to understand the cost of the entire sales and marketing process, and its various constituent pieces.

We would like to know which sources of leads have the highest ROI. To do that we need to know the cost per lead, and the conversion rates to closed deals for each different lead source. Looking at that data combined with the average deal size , will allow us to determine the return on investment for each different lead source.

We would like to know the effectiveness of the various Actions that we are taking to move prospects along the sales cycle. For example, if we are doing Webinars, how effective are those at getting attendees to sign up for a trial? Or if we are spending money on Pay per Click Google Adwords, how well are those visitors to the site converting into registered users on the site (where they have given their contact information)?

Thanks, and remember

 - Thinking programatically means to think of the product as individual parts, but thinking about marketing requires thinking of the product as a whole
